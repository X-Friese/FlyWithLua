FlyWithLua for X-Plane 11
=========================

This is the official source code repository for the FlyWithLua plugin project.

FlyWithLua offers Lua scripting to X-Plane since X-Plane 9.

Discussions to general topics should be opened on the [official forum at x-plane.org](http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?showforum=188).

You will find a binary version ready to use in X-Plane 9 or 10 in the [download area of x-plane.org](http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?app=downloads&showfile=17468).

The new versions are X-Plane 11 only and the binary is also in the [download area of x-plane.org](http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/35579-flywithlua-for-x-plane-11-windows-linux-mac-os-x-version/).

If you want to grab a most nightly binary, just copy the subfolder `FlyWithLua` into your X-Plane's plugin folder.
